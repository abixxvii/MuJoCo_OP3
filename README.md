 This project invites you to delve into the intricacies of physics modeling by creating MuJoCo environments where objects interact, collide, and respond to external forces. 
 Explore the impact of various parameters on collision outcomes, from surface properties to constraint solver settings. 
 Whether it's a ball bouncing off a surface or a complex interplay between multiple objects, witness the nuanced behavior that arises from tweaking simulation parameters. 
 Uncover the secrets of MuJoCo's physics engine and gain insights into how small adjustments can lead to significant changes in simulated dynamics.
